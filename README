>> wBak - Simple automatic server/system (Linux/BSD/OSX) backups and local browsable archival via ZFS snapshots + external GPG encrypted long term storage <<

This is an extended version of my old backup script, it is based on ZFS snapshots as these are simple accessible to restore - implemented on eg. dm-crypt or other encrypted drive(s) this provides somewhat secure storage.

The actual backup process is a simple rsync of /, then a ZFS snapshot is taken and if configured a GPG encrypted (thus secure to share) file is created & synced local/remote by rsync.

Features:
- Simple configuration and installation (eg. Ubuntu 16.04 system and ZFS volume + some packages)
- Supports general excludes as well as single server excludes in server config
- Allows backup scheduling per server (30 min server A, 5 min server B etc.) with default of 60min (set in general config)
- rsync is rather reliable
- ZFS snapshots provide easy access to any data point
- Incremental backups and can be deduplication enabled (not recommended on ZFS on Linux though)
- GPG encrypted backups are highly secure and can be shared to anywhere automated (default all 12 hours the latest snapshot), extend script by eg. FTP or Dropbox/whatever...

See INSTALL for configuration.

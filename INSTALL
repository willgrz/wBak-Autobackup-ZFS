0. Install a Linux system with ZFS (recommended Ubuntu) & generate an SSH key + add it on all systems to be backed up
1. Create ZFS pool and volume for backup storage
   - I use eg. as pool:
   - /pool/backup/server
2. Install packages required on backup server (TAR+GPG if you want encrypted stored, find/sed/rsync/date/awk/bash)
3. Change the config path to this path in the bin/autobackup.sh file
4. Add central excludes to excludes.conf if any
5. Add servers to be backed up as shown in servers.conf commented example
   - These need to have rsync installed
6. Edit autobackup.conf:
   - Leaving defaults & only changing zpool, bbase and backupdir should get you running on Ubuntu 16.04 with existing ZFS pool safely
7. Run bash bin/autobackup.sh --full-backup
   - This enables first run backups and external backups by placing lock files
8. Run bash -x bin/autobackup.sh
   - This runs the script in debug mode to see if everything seems ok
9. Set cronjob to run script all few minutes
